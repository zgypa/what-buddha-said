# What Buddha Said Net

This project wants to resume material from Bhante Samahita in his "what-buddha-said.net" web site. Bhante Samahita took his own life in October of 2019. However, he had collected a useful amount of information on this web site. The attempt of this project is to recover whatever is recoverable from the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org).

The idea is to use Jekyll and Github Pages, while keeping the entire repository open source, so that anyone can contribute.

## Links with material

Here is a list of URLs from the wayback machine that contain useful material which could be ported. All links below should take you to the latest version of the website which contains useful information.

Not all capture dates contain useful material. Many are redirects. This is why this is list useful:browsing through the wayback machine's version normally, you will hit plenty of redirects, and then you will have to go back, paste the original URL in the WayBack Machine's search to find an older, valid version of this page. This is what i have done below.

## Changing style

Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the @import line of the ``assets/css/style.scss`` file.

Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the @import line in your stylesheet.
