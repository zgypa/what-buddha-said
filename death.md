title: "The death of Bhikkhu Samahita"
layout: default

The {{ page.title }} came as a big surprise for most of who knew him. Especially after having read that he took his own life. Like me, probably others might have had many question like "But he is a monk, doesn't he know better?" or "Why didn't he warn us, or plan for it?".

From what i gathered, it appears as if he might have been infected with some
kind of parasite, which could have attacked his nervous system, making him
experience a lot of pain, and loose the ability to reason. Someone commented that his passing happened only a few weeks after his father's passing.

>A dying man can only rely upon his wisdom, if he developed it. Wisdom is not dependent upon any phenomenon originated upon six senses. It is developed on the basis of the discernment of the same.
