# {{ page.title }}

Notes taken from question #327 [Dhamma on Air episode 106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTqIPHUYUTU), and mixed with personal notes.

As soon as there is contact there is feeling. Object enters in contact with eye, nose, tongue, ear, skin and mental, then the mind reacts with a sensation, a feeling. 

Feelings/sensations are just feelings, and have nothing to do with what i am. It's not me, it's this body that is experiencing a particular sensation/feeling.

It is therefore not accurate to state "I am angry". It would be more accurate to state "As a consequence of some object or another having entered in contact with one of my 6 senses, I am now experiencing an unpleasant sensation here or there, and as a consequence of this sensation, the mind is reacting with anger."

## Correlation between type of feeling and object

All feelings can be broken down in three types:

1. pleasant
1. unpleasant
1. neutral

The type of feeling/sensation is not directly correlated with the object which,
by entering in contact with my six senses, has initiated it. In other words, if i
have experienced an unpleasant sensation when entering in contact with a
specific object last month, it is not guaranteed that i will experience a
similar unpleasant sensation when entering in contact with the same object
today. 

As an example, sometimes i like a specific kind of food, but another day i might dislike it. Same thing with your spouse.

The type of feeling, apparently, is karmically determined.
