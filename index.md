{{ page.title }} was a website run and maintained by [Bhikkhu Samahita](https://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Bhikkhu_Samahita), which
contained a large amount of material to help anyone on the buddhist path to
eradicate suffering. Unfortunately, in [October of 2019, he passed away]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link death.md %}), and his
website was left abandoned. 

Unfortunately i didn't realize this quick enough, nor did i realize the consequences, and have not taken any action. Eventually the website hosting he was using ran out, and the domain got bought out by someone. 

However, not everything has gone lost: Even though all of his podcasts and videos are gone from soundcloud, luckily they are still on youtube. And parts of this website are still archived in the the Way Back Machine. I have downloaded his YouTube videos, just in case, and am currently in the process of collecting more information from the archived website.

## Goal

The goal of this website is to make sure that other fellow beings can benefit from Bhikkhu Samahita's nobel hard work by extracting and re-publishing it on an open-source platform, like GitHub, where anyone can download and fork it and contribute to it as much as they like.

## Why GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is certainly not the easiest way to collaborate on content, especially for those who are not developers. But at the same time, i found very little dhamma teachings in the developer world. I chose GitHub Pages because i thought it would be a platform that could guarantee the longest longevity of this content.

* GitHub is a very stable platform.
* GitHub is very well known and available and well indexed by search engines.
* Github hosts any static content of public repos forever, for free.
* Anyone can easily fork the entire project and keep it alive
* Github provides a public and wide array of collaboration tools, like a wiki and an issue tracker.
* I hope to attract the attention of fellow meditators who are also developers.
