Notes taken from question #327 [Dhamma on Air episode 106](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTqIPHUYUTU).

Two Issues:

#. Lack of stabilty, Lack of mindfulness, lack of awareness, lack of Sathi. As soon as mind stops looking at itself, then the mental defilments (aversion, doubts, restlness, lazyness) creep in. As soon as mental awareness is establashed, they will disappear. 

Progress happens only when one is in the state of mindfulness. But as soon as one is not in the state of mindfulness, then one starts to relapse and regress. So it's a continuous up and down.

From dusk to dawn, from the moment of waking until the moment of falling asleep, one trains awareness, mindfulness and clear comprehension. 

## How to train this awarness (Sathi)

1. Contemplate the body as a form, a group of foul and fragile organs, not as me or permanent.
1. Contemplate feelings/sensations simply for what it is, which is a reactive response to sense contact. (See [Feelings and Sensations]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link feelings.md %}))
1. Contemplate mind as a constant mutating moods which are conditions of circumstances.
1. Contemplate phenomena as perceived mental states, not as real physical objects. 

Whatever object or experience we perceive of the real world, only appears to
be out there. In reality, what we consider to be the *real world* is only a
collection of experiences, which we have witnesses through one or more of our
sense doors. This means that everything that is out there, from our
perspective, can only be experiences, not the actual physical object. And
experiences are almost purely mental (they cannot be purely mental, because the
mind and the sense organs are involved, which is a physical object).

This does not exclude the possibility of the presence or the interaction of an actual physical object or phenomena: it merely means there we cannot be 100% certain that there is a physical object. There could be, but there could also not be. 

Either way, the point of coming to this conclusion is that by contemplating as
described above, it becomes easier to de-tach from (as in not get attached to,
not cling to) the world: it's not me, not mine, not what i'm participating in,
it's just an appearing, a flickering state of being which comes and goes. We can
use the wisdom as a tool to help us come out of craving and clinking.


## How to train clear comprehension (Satthi Sampayanna)

Act clearly comprehending whatever one exactly is doing right now. While going forward, one clearly comprehends one is going forward. While eating, drinking, defecating, walking, standing, lying down, while falling asleep, while speaking, while keeping silent, one clearly comprehends one is doing this.

## In daily practice

Then, as one trains the awareness using the four contemplations of body, sensations, mind and phenomena, and then as one trains clear comprehension by clearly understanding what one is doing, then these skills are applied to the pillow and/or to real life.

Another trick of becoming acutely aware and clearly comprehending is to analyze whether there is awareness in this very moment of experiencing whatever what one is experiencing: awareness of awareness itself. If one is aware of awareness, then awareness is definitely on.
