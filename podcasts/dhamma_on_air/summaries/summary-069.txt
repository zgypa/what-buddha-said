The Simile: The "Simile of the Dry Grassland Fire" illustrates how actions driven by evil (sensuality, ill will, cruelty) lead to suffering, while those motivated by good (goodwill, withdrawal, harmlessness) result in happiness and positive outcomes.

Question 1: "How does a Buddhist deal with aversions, anger, and sadness?". The answer focuses on countering hate (aversions/anger) with universal friendliness (Metta Bhavana) and overcoming sadness by addressing subconscious regrets or cultivating joy (Piti) and observing moods as impermanent.

Question 2: "Why does the good only win in fiction and the evil always win in the real life? Why the current trials of good people while prosperity of the wicked ones? Does morality not, matter?". The monk explains this perception as a "sampling error" due to short observation time, asserting that evil ultimately leads to downfall and encouraging listeners to focus on their own purity.

Question 3: "Is the breath body the physical body, or is it something else?". The answer describes the "breath body" as a distinct, subtle movement felt during Anapanasati meditation, separate from physical air, and highly recommends this practice for mental stillness and enlightenment.
