Question 243: How to battle Marijuana

- Humungous vice
- Organic defects are not as evident as in alcohol, where 3 million people die from it every year. Delirium tremens, you die in less than 3 days untreated, 80% morality.
- When alcohol addicts are passed a certain stage, they must go to doctor, but very few do. Most people drink for 20 years then they die of it.
- Family horrors, economic deroute.
- THC addictions is relatively easy compared to morphine, alcohol.
    - Looking at the dangers of future lives and present life
    - Future lives: skizophrenia, severe depression, anxiety.
    - This life is similar: increased probabilities of getting schizophrenia, anxiety and depression later in life
    - There is a genetic predisposition where THC + Gene = Schizo. Whether one's schizo condition is caused by pure THC or only by the combination of genetic predisposition and THC is unclear at the moment, but this doesn't matter, because the single user doesn't know if he/she has the genetic background to become schizo. Is it THC->schizo or only THC+gene->schizo? Who cares, because we know that gene alone does not lead to schizo. But if he smokes, he will get it right now. And if he/she never smokes, he might never see the diseasae, even though he has the genes for it.
    - Memory loss, both short and long term.
    - Loss of intelligence 6-8 points for chronic users.
    - If one starts smoking a lot in teenage years, it is not possible to regain the loss.
    - If one starts smoking as an adult, intelligence may be regained, but it takes 3 months.
    - THC as a very long half life, takes 3 months. Carelessness and laziness will carry on for a long time.
    - Performance goes does, impulse controls go down, 
    - Mistrust, shame, paranoia, negative emotions, anger, guilt, bad Consciousness, reality impairment, grandiousity, severe disorganization, forgetfulness, impaired social, personal neglegt, slow movement, lack of insight, irresponsability, marital/child neglect, legal problems.
    - All kinds of sense addiction it arises when thought comes to the object. A single thought about the addicted object is enough to start the craving, which causes more thoughts, which cause more craving, until one does it. 
    - So where does it cease? Right where it arises. By being able to see the contact with the mind, and accept it as such. Once the craving comes in, it becomes too difficult to stop the escalation.
