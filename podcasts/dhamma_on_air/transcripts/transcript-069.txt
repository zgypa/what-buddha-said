Friends, what is this fundamental right awareness? That noble, eight foot way, leading to Nibbana is simply this, right view, right motivation, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right awareness, and right concentration. But what is right awareness? The fourfold definition of right awareness is, one, awareness of the body, merely a certain and constructed frame. Two, awareness of feelings just as conditioned emotional responses.

Three, awareness of mind only as a habituated and temporary set of moods. Four, awareness of all phenomena only as constructed mental states. Right awareness is of these four, while being alert and clearly comprehending. This will put away any longing towards and any aversion against anything in this world. The blessed Buddha once said, friends, this is the only direct way to the mental purification of beings, to the overcoming and elimination of all sorrow, all frustration, all pain, and all misery, to gaining the right method, to the realization of Nibbana.

That is this establishing of exactly these four foundations of awareness, These four great frames of reference. The core concept is SUS. These four foundations of right awareness are one, being aware of the body only as a transient form or frame. Two, being aware of the feeling just as a reactive response. Three, being aware of the mind merely as a passing set of moods.

Four, being aware of any phenomenon solely as a mental state, and nothing else. For instance, awareness is indeed a mountain of advantage. The explanation of acute awareness and clear comprehension goes like this. When inhaling and exhaling long, one notices and is fully aware of just that. When inhaling and exhaling short, one notices labels and is fully aware of just that.

One trains. I will breathe in and out clearly comprehending the entire body. One trains. I will breathe in and out, calming the breath and all bodily activity. When walking, one notices and clearly comprehends that one is walking.

When standing, one notices and clearly comprehends that one is standing. When sitting, one notices and clearly comprehends that one is sitting. When lying down, one notices and clearly comprehends that one is lying down. Going forward, one notices and clearly comprehend is going forward. When returning, one notices and clearly comprehend is returning.

When looking in front or to the back, one notices and is clearly aware of just that. When bending or stretching, when lifting or carrying, when eating or drinking, chewing or tasting, One is aware and mentally labels just that, bending, bending, chewing, chewing, eating, eating. When passing excrement or urine, one clearly comprehends exactly that. When falling asleep and when waking up, when speaking or keeping silent, one notices, knows, and understands exactly that and clearly comprehends that this is what one is doing right there and exactly right now. Continuous awareness of purpose, suitability, domain, and nature of one's current behavior, whether mental, verbal, or bodily activity is right awareness and clear comprehension.

The characterization of right awareness, awareness of wrong view, or right view, present now, is right awareness. Awareness of wrong motivation or right motivation is right awareness. Awareness of wrong speech or right speech now is right awareness. Awareness of wrong action or right action done now is right awareness. Awareness of wrong livelihood or right livelihood is right awareness.

Awareness of wrong effort or right effort at this very moment is right awareness. Awareness or wrong awareness or right awareness is right awareness. Awareness or wrong or right concentration right now is right awareness. The function of right awareness and its associated mental states. Knowing right versus wrong awareness as right versus wrong awareness is right for you.

Exchanging wrong awareness with right awareness is right effort. Right awareness has the function of observing, noticing, remembering, and knowing the true reality, That neither anybody, nor any form, nor any feeling, nor any mentality, nor any phenomena, nor any mental state, is real, lasting happiness, Not truly attractive, nor lasting, nor satisfying, nor something too bekipped, nor even personal. All phenomena are momentary. They pass away right at the moment of their arising and occurrence. Nothing is permanent.

Everything is in a state of flux, arising and ceasing, emerging and vanishing, coming and going, again and again and again and ever again. Continuously seeing this strangeness, this impermanence, and thus this dissatisfactoriness, an impersonality is right awareness. For further study on right awareness, samma siddhi, go to whatbuddhasaid.net, and search for awareness. Thank you. Hello to you, friends.

This is Dhamma on air number 69 recorded indoor because of weather, wind, and rain. There are three questions. One, Damasara building report. But first, the normal intro. And perfectly self enlightened.

First off the bat, I'd like to remind you to subscribe down there in the right corner, under the small red sign, and click the small bell that is under this video to the left side, right under the window, so you become informed about the future videos. And then, we will check the Dhammasara building report, video report and it comes right here. Hello to you friends, this is just to update you on the meditation hall. The island has been carried up here and half of the sand that is a significant part of the world is to carry this sand 35 kilos per bag up here in 4,000 feet elevation because there is no road access. Next up is a cement bag, 20 cement bags.

So tomorrow we will start to bend these, iron rods and make the armament for, this wall that will be a part of the foundation, one quarter of the foundation for, the meditation hall. I just like to say then, thanks for your keen attention, clever consideration and kind contribution. We have just started building the meditation hall. Which is very necessary because it's raining up here it's not raining now whistling and I'll make some video there will come some video about next week but donations and support for this meditation roof for meditators that comes up here is very welcome still and it's this of course enables them to approach Nirvana and when you give somebody else the opportunity to approach Nirvana then you get the very same thing back from the karmic mirror that reflects this good opportunity giving back to the donor. So this is worth remembering giving others opportunity to reach deathlessness thereby increases one's probability and ability to gain this very same deathlessness this very same Nirvana this very same irreversible end of suffering, this very same lasting happiness oneself.

Worth remembering is that We have just started building the meditation hall which is very necessary because it's raining up here. It's bad raining now. Whistling. And I will make some video there will come some video about it next week but donations and support for this meditation roof for meditators that comes up here is very welcome still and it's this of course enables them to approach Nirvana and when you give somebody else the opportunity to approach nirvana then you get the very same thing back from the khanic mirror that reflects this good opportunity giving back to the donor. So this is worth remembering giving others opportunity to reach deathlessness thereby increases one's probability and ability to gain this very same deathlessness, this very same Nirvana, this very same universal end of suffering, this very same lasting happiness, oneself.

Worth remembering is that Thank you for your attention, support and contribution. So much for building the Dhammasara, the meditation hall, the Babana Sala, which have started now, I think will progress little by little, and I will send a video update whenever there's something to tell about. Support is very welcome at whatbutterset.net. The simile is a simile of the grey dress land. Putting fire to that.

And it's from the Samutani Kaye which you see here. Book 14 on the elements, Datu. And it is supta or thread or speech number 12. On the dry grassland fire. So the Buddha there, he points out that nothing comes without a cause, without a source.

And he say, as long as there is sensuality, then there will be a perception of sensuality. And thereby also intention for sensuality, passion for sensuality, urge for sensuality and quest for sensuality where you start searching for it. As long as there is this element or this aspect of evil, of anger, then there will be perception of anger and evil driven by this hate dosa. There will be intention, desire, urge and quest driven by this illiberal, this desire, this hate. And he said, as long as there's cruelty, this element of cruelty, this aspect of cruelty, then there will be perception of cruelty, revenge, harming others.

There will be intention, there will be passion, urge and search, and quest defined by this cruelty. So, this ordinary being was not schooled in the noble ones teaching. Because of these three elements of sensuality, ill will and cruelty, He performs, by way of body, speech, and mind, actions that later brings his own downfall. In this life he will live as Rana Seers performed these actions, these evil actions, these detrimental actions, these Akusara actions, then he will live in vexation, in sorrow, in regret, in remorse, and at the moment of the break up of the body, then he will experience downforce, or whatever, sometimes even hell. While on the other hand, you have also the opposite aspects of these three evil aspects of sense desire, craving for sensing, ill will, opposition, aversion, cruelty, harmfulness.

Namely, you have the aspect of goodwill. And as long as there is an aspect of goodwill, of friendliness, then there will also be perception of this universal friendliness. There will also be intention, compassion, and quest, search and urge for this friendliness, driven by this friendliness, goodwill, or altruistic activity of helping others, assisting others. This is driven by this good will. And so also there is this aspect of withdrawal, the opposite of sense craving, of renunciation, of letting go, of saying, okay, I don't need it.

The opposite of greed, actually. This aspect of withdrawal, when there is this aspect, then there's also perception of withdrawal, of pulling out, begging out, the opposite of involvement, the opposite of self entanglement. When there's this aspect then there's also the perception of withdraw. Intention driven by withdraw, forward draw. Urge and search and quest for withdraw.

To go forth, to go into a meditation course or center actually is driven by this, that you want to withdraw out of society, out of the buzz, out of the stress, out of the confusion of normal ordinary life in the city. So there's also this aspect, the opposite of cruelty is harmlessness. As long as there's this element, this aspect of harmlessness, then there's perception of harmlessness, intention for harmlessness, passion for harmlessness, Search and urge and quest for harmlessness. People who work for protection of animals and children and so on, they are driven by this quest for harmlessness. All these three aspects of withdrawal, goodwill and harmlessness, then this noble being, this noble disciple, motivated by these three right motivations of withdrawal, goodwill and harmlessness.

They perform advantageous, good, right, correct behavior by body, speech and mind. And because of the accumulation of probability, the karmic accumulation of probability for these good actions, these good karma, these good intentions, then they live the life in happiness. They dwell in contentment and bliss, and they do not live in vexation, confusion, fear, or worries, regret, and remorse. They do not. At the breakup of the body, similarly so they can expect a good rebirth at a higher level of existence, either a higher level of existence in the human state or a higher level of existence in one of the many divine states.

So he says it's like this, the evil doer is like this being inflamed by these three states of sense greed, of ill will and cruelty, it's like a man who goes out in a fire, on a grassland and then he torch it with a blazing torch, then because he torches with a blazing torch, soon a lot of beings living in the grass, snakes, insects, worms and so on, they die. They come to a catastrophic future. And similar with himself also. Why is that so? Because he sets fire to his own mind by these mental states of sense desire, great for sensuality, ill will and cruelty.

And he doesn't put out the fire, he doesn't put out the fire with hands and feet immediately put out the fire before it comes too big. While the noble disabled, he outs he might set fire accidentally to this dry grassland and it might start burning but then quickly he quells down the fire with hands and feet and extinguishes right on the spot so that no being there, and neither himself, either, comes to any harm, and therefore he experiences bliss. So it is with any who is in training, mental training. As soon as they see this, ill will, this desire, this greed, this cruelty emerge in divine, then they should cool it down instantly, quickly, before it starts burning of their own life and other beings' life. Quickly, quickly, quickly.

This to see that there is greed in the mind, to see that there is ill will in the mind, in the form of irritation, anger, opposition, rigidity, or cruelty, revengefulness, ah, whether if this being who I perceive as my enemy, I hope they will die or they will come to some accident or you'll fall from their success. This, you have to see it arise. If you don't see it arise, then one might deny that it is there. But then it's like an unseen danger, a spy behind own lines that is working his damage behind the lines in secrecy. So once you see this mental state arise and then immediately, immediately, instantly, right on the spot, quell them out, dispel them, eradicate them, eliminate them before they make any damage by accumulation of bad karma, before they make thought go on along these lines of great sense desire, ill will, aversion, harmfulness, and cruelty.

Before they start going down the road of this torrent of bad thoughts, then one should put in the brake, and call the fire, right there, right there. Then one is not burned by suffering. So much for the simile of the dry grassland is from the connected discourses which you see here of the Buddha, the Samyutta Nikaya, and the speech on the sources, the sources, from book 14 number 12. Then we go to the question, how does a question number 205, how does a Buddhist deal with aversions, anger, and sadness? First, we take aversions and anger.

They're all derivatives of hate, dosa. That's his three bad roads, three mula, evil mula, evil roots, greed, hate, and ignorance. A hate, dorsa, if you take hate and dilute it, then you get anger. If you take anger and dilute that, then you get aversion. It's still hate, but it's called by another name, but it's still basically the same, just dilute it or diminish it a little bit.

If you take that aversion and dilute it, then you get opposition. If you take opposition and dilute it, you're against something or somebody, and then you get mental rigidity that you're not able to change a standpoint of you or see other things that you that your own opinion. Usually, people who are like that, they become stubborn or they are called simple minded, not without a reason. So all these derivatives of hate such as irritation, anger, imposition, stubbornness, they should be counteracted by this Metabhavala, the cultivation of universal friendliness, which one tries to make infinite in the following way. May all beings be happy, makes one's mentor For repetition in the boss, on the workplace, wherever, may all beings be exceedingly happy.

May they be content. May they find only success. May they never come into any harm. May all beings in this room, in this company, in this office, in this family, in this social group, in this country, on this planet, in this galaxy, in this entire cosmos, may they be happy. This one beams from one's heart towards the hearts of the receptor, in front, to the side, to the back, to the left, above as below, and into the midi right directions also, and it's 10 directions.

When one is finished beaming this, meta, this universal, infinite friendliness, don't make it finite. Make it infinite, endless, boundless, because in the response, atomic response will also be infinite, endless, boundless. So when one is halfway into this universal friendliness repetition mantra, then once anger has evaporated completely, it's it's not to be seen. It's disappeared. So universal friendliness, cultivation of universal friendliness, on the pillow, in the bus, especially when, people speak angry to you or attack you or oppose you in some way, then this aspect should be brought forward.

May they be happy. May they be content. May they meet only success. And then you will see that their attitude towards you gradually melts down. And they become, okay, we can talk about it.

Affected by this universal friendliness. Buddha, he he emphasizes a lot and and he had a famous family of the saw, he said, if some robbers, they come and cut off your arms and legs one by one by a two handled saw, then you should not be angry with them, you should not just be friendly with them and be universal friendliness towards them. And there was many examples from the Buddha's own Jataka prior life stories, that when he did that, even when buried or hanging with his head down, taken prisoner from another king, together with his son, hang Hank down in his own courtyard to be executed later on, Then he maintained this universal friendliness. And therefore, this king who has taken him as prisoner, he he he put him down and said, okay, I cannot execute you anyway. I leave you a castle.

And then he said, goodbye. So he was affected non locally by this immense consciousness of universal friendliness. So this is a cure for all hate, anger, irritation, opposition, stubbornness, and mental rigidity. Meta, universal friendliness. The best of the best.

Then there's sadness. Sadness is the opposite of gladness. So sadness, once you first consider, is, some think I've done wrong. So this sadness is because of regret and remorse that is subconscious and I don't realize. Have I upstreamed before in time, as long as I can remember, done anything wrong, that I have not repaired or regretted or apologized for, or seen myself as a mistake?

Because doing such anything evil upstream in time, then later down in time one will experience this sadness and may not be aware of what the cause is. Then when one sees, ah, I did this and that wrong, I didn't give, I didn't share anything, I was very envious, I was very desirous of other people's positions, spouses, wealth, or whatever. And then seeing that envy, jealousy, or evilness, usually, one sees it as that, not defends it, or denies it, or neglects it, then this sadness evaporates. That's a preventive measure, you can say, is see seeing that the the seal, the morality has been broken upstream in time, and the effect of that is sadness now, the the karmic response. The karmic ego is sadness now.

So this should be seen and cleared up, cleaned up. Then there's another trick, to eradicate sadness, and this is the opposite is gladness. Gladness is very closely related to joy, piti, which actually is a factor of enlightenment, a link to enlightenment, a wing to enlightenment, this joy, this piti. And how to, how to feed that, how to provide the cause of that. That's a very interesting, feedback loop because joy feeds itself.

If you turn attention rationally, You turn attention to joy, then you experience more joy. You can try now. Turn your attention to joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, then joy arise right there. And to those who do it, often it comes to fulfillment. Then they have an un joy bottom because joy and sadness cannot coexist in their mind.

Then when joy arises, sadness goes away. And the opposite is also the case. When sadness comes, joy goes away. So if you provide joy, then sadness is gone. But one has to see the sadness as sadness.

That takes awareness. Awareness of what? Awareness of mood, seeing mind as moods, set of conditioned moods. Article three in awareness. Seeing the body as a frame, seeing the feeling as a response, seeing the mind as a set of moods, and seeing all phenomena as mental states, not something real, lasting, happy, satisfying.

Me, mine. I don't know. So, seeing the mind as mood, these moods, they come and go, but, one experiences these moods not as me or mine, but something that is as remote. It the the mood is still there, but it's it's kind of remote. It doesn't bother you because you it's not your mood anyway.

So it's just moods that come and arise and go and seize and blah blah blah. So what? So what? As my day is saying. So if something is seeing the mind as moods, then you it implies, it entails automatically seeing the mood, the present mood, whether it's gladness or sadness, as something remote, as something alien, as something not me or mine.

And thereby it doesn't bother you. It doesn't bother you. You can easily let it go in Entangle. And because it's impermanent per se, inherently impermanent, then it can evaporate right there on the spot. And if one is clever then one exchanges it with something one wants either equanimity or joy, pity by thinking of joy.

Actively, deliberately redirecting the mind from a bad state to a good state. Right there on the spot, but it takes awareness first. Awareness of the mind, seen as moods only. Not me, not mine, not what I am. Just the mind, the patience of sin with wounds.

So this was, question two zero five. Question two zero six, why does the good only win in fiction and the evil always win in the real life? Why the current trials of good people while prosperity of the wicked ones? Does morality not, matter? This has, morality does matter, and, the mistake that is done here is, I think I agree with the analysis, the evil people and the evil has upper hand at the moment, and the Buddha he spoke about these times as the future dangers, where the evil will be stronger than the good and therefore the evil people, those who have these evil characteristics, they will have the upper hand.

You can see all levels, governments, university, departments, private organizations, private companies, in the family, wherever, wherever. It's not the good people, the good people, they kind of like bend down and big the thing and try to get out of the mess. But if you look on the little longer run, then this evil, if you see them down the road after their life, the breakup of the body after death, then they experience downfall. At least you don't see with the good ones. They they go out the other way around.

So it's because of not observing long enough. If you observe the evildoers long enough then eventually you will see them fall down. Ah yes, they were hanging high on the tree as long as only those who act with the dirty tricks, they can win the game. Then they will hang high on the trees. But, suddenly if they are not, taken down from this tree by all other that fights about this rotten meat in society, these leadership positions, fame and name in society, if they are not taken down by their competitors, then at death they will be taken down by their own action, by their own accumulation of probability.

So don't despair. Just hang in there. Mind your own business. What the others do, right or wrong, it's not your business. Your business is to clean your own backyard for evil tendencies.

Among those, revengefulness and pointing out others' mistakes. Look at your own instead. Let's clean the outcome. I can assure you. If you if you look hard enough, you will you don't have to look very hard, then you will see plenty of mistakes.

Plenty of greed and ignorance. Deal with that. What the other people do is irrelevant for the path. It takes one away from the path by starting blaming and pointing out blah blah blah. And one also becomes sad about seeing the state of human beings, at the present in the present society.

It's not a British side, I agree with that. But, again, so what? It's not relevant to see that. Focus on your own path. To use this situation of the wicked ones, winning the game is a very good way of seeing suffering, seeing the first noble truth, all this is suffering, see?

How corrupt they are, how they behave shamelessly, completely unhinged, raving in evilness. Well, yes, so is it, so is society, so society is suffering. There's no blooming harmonious utopia anywhere to be found, not even among the billions. However, it's better and better the higher you come, more and more harmonious the higher you come. But it's not free of ignorance before enlightenment.

I hope, so again, the evil ones doesn't win on the long run. So it's sampling error, it's too short observation time. If you look long enough, then there will be downfall. However high they are. So, it's sampling error, as we say in science, is because of looking too short from the cause to the effect.

But if you only look in this frame, time frame, then you don't see the effect down here. So you make wrong conclusion on too short time frame of observation. Sampling error, basically. So don't despair. Focus on your own path, your own mental defilement.

The others is not your business. It's not your backyard. It's not your carpet. Look under your own carpet. There's plenty of dirt.

Get that out. That's bliss. Then you also experience that whatever the others do when you have reduced your mental defilements, then you can go even among the uneven. You can be without hate among the haters. You can be without greed among the greedy.

Doesn't matter. So, as the Buddhists say, one is not soiled by the world. One is like a lotus flower that grows in the mud, but rises out of the mud without being soiled by it, without taking any of the dirt of greed, hate and ignorance from the surrounding society, however much is offered, upon oneself, one is not participating in this dogfight of the society. Race. Social race.

Social position gain. One is not participating and therefore one is not soiled by it. If one do participate, become involved in it, become emotionally affected by it and have to point out and try to correct it and so on, Then one becomes solved by hate and greed and ignorance. So don't do that. Will draw out of it.

Pull out. Focus on own path, on own purification. That's the deal, the real deal. That's the noble way. Question two zero seven.

Is the breath body the physical body, or is it something else? That's just Anapanasati, there's four tetrads, the third point in the first tetrads he trains us experiencing the entire body I will breathe in and out. And you can look at what buddhasaid.net there's one in the drops called experiencing the breath. So the breath body, I have to say I don't know what it is. It is very very captivating.

It is best experienced directly when having trained for a significant time then you experience this training as the commentary says where you have to point out the beginning of the exhalation, the middle of the exhalation and the end of the exhalation. Stop. So these three points you have to identify, the beginning, middle and end. And so also with the inhalation. The beginning of the inhalation, the middle of the inhalation, and the end of the inhalation.

And this should just keep training on. Then suddenly you will experience that there's something going out of the nose or the mouth that is not the air. After the air has stopped, something else is passing out. There's some movement of something. What this something is?

I currently don't know. It's very interesting. I have to say I have no idea of what it is but it is perceivable. It is definitely not the air. It can be just like consciousness is superimposed on the physical body then there can be other aspects also could be movement, could be a combination.

This is superimposed on the physical body like more pains on the same frame so to speak. When this, if they were separate but then you could experience them as separate And this I think only is in certain conditions for example experiencing the consciousness leaving the body and coming back to the body is in this near death experiences for example or during transmigration one can also. But it's very rare events where one can experience a separation between consciousness and the body and so also between the breath body and the physical body, the breath body and the air. But what I am saying to you is that if you do this Anapanasati, breathing in and out meditation, doing which all the Buddhas enlightened, they use all this method of breathing meditation for enlightenment. If you try to experience the entire body as the entire breath, as the entire inhalation and exhalation.

And you do as the commentary says. You deliberately and for a long period mark the beginning, the middle, and the end of the inhalation, the beginning, middle, and the end of the exhalation. Then at the beginning and the end of inhalation and exhalation, you can feel something else. That's the breath body. It's a movement.

It's felt like a movement. I cannot express it, closer than that. But it's not air move because you can feel distinctly that the air stops. Buck. The lungs doesn't move, the chest doesn't move, the stomach doesn't move.

There's nothing passing in and out, no streaming of air. Still there's some movement that kind of like goes out and then stops. Then there's total stillness. Then before, when you kind of like decide to start to move in, breathe in, then there's this in movement of something before you actually start to breathe in. What it is?

I have no idea. But it's I think it's very descriptive to call the breath body. Very descriptive. So also is a, I think movement is the best description I can come with. It's movement of something that is not air.

So it's it's connected superimposed with the physical body but is distinct from that in special situations. I hope that's answered the question. I just, give a little, hello also for this breathing meditation, Anapanasana meditation, because in during these present times where stress and conceptual a conceptual overcooking, conceptual thinking, intellectualization, worries, regret, speculation, and so on, is so, extremely common, then it's good to silence the mind, to still this conceptual thinking. And this is exactly what this Anapanasani breathing meditation does. Second thing is it can induce all fourth jhanas.

So it can take you all the way to enlightenment with only one single meditation object. That is unsurpassable. Unsurpassable. So I can really recommend it. Just go for go to whatbuddhaset.net and search for breathing meditation or Anapan Sati.

Anapana, breathe in, Pana, without Sati, awareness. Awareness won, gained by watching, noticing, observing. The breathing in, the breathing out. Simple, yet still subtle yet still profound yet still complex but very effective. Thanks for your keen attention, clever consideration and kind contribution.

Thanks to all the daikas, the supporters and the donors, and as I said before, support for the meditation pavilion that will enable other beings to approach Nibbana will also enable you to approach Nibbana by the karmic echo effect. Remember? Remember? Remember to become a member by clicking subscribe down there in the right corner and click the little bell under the video in the left corner And that's it for today. Worthy, honorable, and perfectly, perfectly self enlightened.

Was blessed, Buddha. Thank you, and have a nice day. Friends, the vulnerable truth, Jyotari, Arya Sechani, which is the very core of Buddhism, are one. All this and such is suffering, Tukka. True.

Clearly. Is the cause of all suffering. Three. Absence of all craving is the end of all suffering. For the noble eight four way leads to the end of all suffering.

The noble eight four way leading to Nibbana is simply this. Right view, right motivation, right speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right effort, Right awareness, and right concentration, samasamadhi. But what is right livelihood? What is this critical right livelihood? The five fold definition of right livelihood is, one, earning a living not involving any trading, well-being beings.

Two, earning a living not involving any selling of meat, fish, or fish. Three, earning a living not involving any selling of any form of weapons. Four, earning a living not involving any dealing with alcohol or illegal drugs. Five, earning a living not involving any selling of any form of poison. That is right livelihood.

The characterization of right livelihood for laypeople is as follows. Any livelihood that neither involves any killing, injuring, harming, nor any forced imprisoning of any living being, nor stealing, taking what is not giving, cheating, any bribery, or corruption, or lie, or false deceiving, tricks, or for use of false measures or weights, neither in essential nor in sexual abuse, neither the use of selling of alcohol, nor of intoxicating illegal drugs that causes carelessness, neither by oneself nor by getting nor inciting others, employees, to do so. Such is right livelihood. And right livelihood for Buddhist monks and nuns, the monastic Sangha, is neither living by receiving food by astrology, soothsaying, prediction of future events, nor by palmistry, geomancy, dream reading, charms or spells, amulets or fake divination, nor by any rituals, running errands, or messages, political flatter, arranging marriages, funerals, or divorces, nor by medical practices, nor by producing art, poetry, or in professional disputation or debate. That is right livelihood.

For further study in Buddhist right livelihood, samma at jivo. Go to whatbuddhaset.net and search for what is right livelihood. Thank you for your attention, consideration, and contribution, and have a nice day.
